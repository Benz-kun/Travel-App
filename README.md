This is a very simple Travel based Flutter application that brings together several small but useful tools in a single interface. The app acts as a central hub where users can explore travel destinations, calculate EMIs and manage their expenses.

The main home screen provides easy navigation to each feature, allowing users to move between the travel explorer, EMI calculator and budget manager. The project demonstrates how multiple independent screens can be structured, organized, and interconnected within a single Flutter application using named routes. Overall, it serves as a simple example of building a modular Flutter app that integrates different functionalities into one unified experience.
